<!-- Usage -->

In this project I have used react-routing v6 for routing and redux for state management.
In the dasboard we have used swiper js for slider and tailwind for styling.Instead of this in the header we have couple of compoents like search, cart login, register, logout.
when i am doing the login and register i have stored the data in the local storage.
without login user can't be purchase the items. login is a mandatory to purchase the items. user can be able to add the product in the cart and the cart section the user can be able to delete the product. the data is stored in the table format. if user click any product image it will redirect to me dynamic product route there should be able to see the particular product details.
